    <h2>My Favorite Place</h2>

    <img src="DEHRADUN.jpeg" alt="Dehradun">

    <p>Dehradun is my favorite place because it feels like a perfect escape from the rush of everyday life. The cool weather, peaceful hills, and greenery everywhere instantly lift my mood. Whether it’s sipping hot chocolate in the cold breeze or walking through quiet streets surrounded by mountains, Dehradun always makes me feel calm and happy. It’s a place that feels both refreshing and comforting, like a second home.</p>
